   To configure static networking, replace the example reference with
         information for your environment:

                     Syntax
ip=<TARGETHOST_IP>::<GATEWAY_IP>:<NETMASK>::<INTERFACE_NAME>:none

                     Legend

    - <TARGETHOST_FQDN>  =  FQDN of the target host
    - <TARGETHOST_IP>  =  IP of the target host
    - <GATEWAY_IP>  =  IP of the network gateway.
    - <NETMASK> =  broadcast netmask for the host.
    - <INTERFACE_NAME>  =  name of the network adapter to use.

                     Sample
