== DNS

. **DNS** +
DNS resolution (both forward and reverse lookups) must function properly between all hosts. +
. **Wildcard DNS Entry** +
Wildcard DNS entry must be in place and point to the load balancer to properly route requests to the OpenShift routers. +
. **Example DNS Wildcard Entry** (assuming example.com is the domain name): +
*.apps 300 IN A 10.1.7.109 +

. **Entry in /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml:** +
routingConfig: +
  subdomain:  "apps.example.com"

. **Test of default route** (Success equals: the IP address of the loadbalancer is returned) +
Anything could be substituted for `test-app` in the following example. +
nslookup `test-app`.app.example.com +
Server:		10.1.7.254 +
Address:	10.1.7.254#53 +
+
Name:	test-app.apps.example.com +
Address: 10.1.7.109
