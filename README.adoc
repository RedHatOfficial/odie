 OpenShift (Container Platform) Disconnected installer (for) Enterprises!
```

ODIE is a distribution of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on custom media for installation into environments without access to the internet. These environments often are segregated the enterprise network and
may lack other common services necessary for an OCP installation.  This can frustrate pilots or short-term engagements where the bulk of the time is consumed with basic logistics of getting disconnected media.

ODIE attempts to resolve that by providing simple media that is easy to install and provides everything you will need to perform an installation.  The key benefits include:

* Vanilla OpenShift - there should be no functional difference between an OCP cluster installed via repositories on the internet and one deployed using ODIE, including container images from supplemental products - RHOCS, RHOAR, SCL, xPaaS, Red
* Hat JBoss portfolio
* Drop-in Installation - ODIE can autonomously provisioned into a ready environment without user intervention
* Batteries Included - all services needed for a disconnected OCP cluster are provisioned during initial setup:
** DNS
** DHCP
** TFTP (PXE booting)
** NTP
** rsyslogd
** httpd server - hosting yum repository
** Docker distribution Container image registry
* Curated lists of RPM and container image contents - reliable, easy-to-use scripts to download specific images and minimize media size
* Spinning! - time spent staring at installation screens is greatly improved with patented SkunkDog spinning technology and improved log displaying

ODIE is a bootstrapping tool and method for transferring into the disconnected environment.  The services provided within are intended to help that initial installation phase.  Customers should consider adopting other technologies
such as IdM, Red Hat Satellite, and Red Hat Quay for production grade environments.  *Please discuss migration strategies with your Red Hat sales team.*

# Media Overview

ODIE is provided as a series of ISOs that are designed to be burned using traditional 4.7GB single layer DVD (our testing identified a significant coaster rate when attempting to boot on dual layer media).  These different ISOs include:

* *baseline* (3.3 GB) - This contains all RPMs and the minimal set of container images that are necessary produces a single ISO that contains everything necessary to install a base installation OpenShift Container Platform.  This disc is bootable when burned with the necessary flags.
* *extras* - (3.0 GB) Contains additional OCP services require the supplemental disc.
* *appdev* - Base application frameworks and containers including most of Red Hat's images from Software Collection Libraries, Source-to-Images, Red Hat JBoss. **NOTE: Application dependencies (i.e. Maven Central, NPM) are not provided and require alternate solutions.**

All of these image set ISOs can be used directly by the `stage-iso.sh`, which simplifies the usage of these ISO files without burning.

# Build Process

**The ISOs contain official Red Hat binaries and are not made available to the public.  They can be built only with the https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Access] account with OpenShift accounts.  **


The following requirements are:

* A clone of the https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/odie[ODIE Source Code] into the `/opt/odie/src` directory, due to the https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/odie/issues/21[several hardcoded paths for development].
* Your user will also need write access into `/opt/odie/config`.
* A RHEL 7.x host that is properly subscribed to your user account (e.g. `sudo subscription-manager register`)
* At least 100GB available in the `/opt/` partition

*_If you want to deploy locally, please review the KVM setup section below._*


You will now prepare your local environment for building.  This is an interactive command and will require TTY shell.

```
make initial_setup
```

Upload the RHEL 7.5 ISO to the location defined in `/opt/odie/config/build.yml`:

```
rhel_iso: /opt/odie/media/rhel-server-7.5-x86_64-dvd.iso
```

While the ODIE build process is *make* based, some of the commands require special variables.  Thus for most operations you would use the `build.sh` wrapper script.  If you need to, you may invoke make targets directly, and the `Makefile` is relatively straightforward.

Do perform a complete release candidate build, execute the following: 

```
./build.sh --clean --full --all --release --deploy

```

Typically, downloading of the content (e.g. `--full`) only needs to occur once per OCP release.  Refer to the wiki for more information about https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/odie/wiki/ContainerImageManifests[Container image manifest/downloads] and https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/odie/wiki/RPMDownloadProcess[generation of the RPM download manifest].


SO for typical ODIE development/hacking, you will want to run the following:

```
./build.sh --base --deploy

```

There are several different options available in the `build.sh` script:

```
Media Options
  --full    -f  Download the RPMS and container images
  --images  -i  Download the container images
  --rpm   -m  Download the RPMs

Build Output Options
  --base        Create the bootable base ISO incl. base OCP images
  --extra       Create the extra ISO containing additional OCP services
  --appdev      Create the baseline ISO
  --mega        Create mega ISO which includes a superset of all the images

  --all         Create all 4 ISOs

General Options
  --bump    -b  Increment the version number for the build
  --clean   -c  Clean the entire output directories (be careful) --deploy  -d  Provision a ODIE cluster using this ISO via KVM
  --help    -h  Display this useful help information
  --none    -n  Remove all the default operations
  --release -r  Tag this release and create PDFs
  --tail    -t  Tail the log during the build
```


## JumpHost Installation



## ODIE Functions

When you first get a JumpHost installed, you should run `odie setup`


### `odie setup`

This aggregate function combines the commands `odie properties`, `odie configure`, `odie generate-config` and `odie push` for a push-button ODIE setup process.


Additionally, if your gateway hosts a (e.g. http://192.168.124.1/odie-config.tar.xz) 


_The goal is to have a systemd unit that will run on the initial startup.  Debugging this has been difficult since the system refuses to boot with this unit in place (keep in mind this was taken directly from a RHT support case).  Will be
implemented by GA_

### `odie properties`

This command generates the configuration files found at `/opt/odie/config` based on the configuration from `conf/manifest.conf` (_this desperately needs to be renamed prior to GA_) .  


Alternatively, you can re-run a single file.  If you ever want to "reset" a file back its original state, simply delete it and re-run this commands specifying the basename of the file to be generated:

```
./odie.sh properties build.yml
```

These files are tagged with the ODIE version at time of creation.  After future updates of ODIE, you can re-run this command and any new properties added to ODIE will be non-destructively appended on your existing property files.


### `odie generate-config`

This command will update the Kickstart files (`/opt/odie/ks/`) and the OCP inventory file (`/opt/odie/src/inventory/inventory`).  It should be rerun after changing any of the configuration files.


### `odie configure`

This command configures all of the core services.  The `/opt/odie/config/odie.yml` file defines a number of these services.  Re-run `odie configure` to re-apply any change.

### `odie install`

This is the command that actually installs OCP.  It assumes that you have already provisioned your VMs.

#### Opinionated Installation

With this approach, you define your environment through the ODIE configuration files.

There are sample `hosts.csv` files in the `/opt/odie/config/` directory to choose from.  Also review all of the files under `/opt/odie/config/`, paying particular attention to `env.yml` which has mandatory changes necessary for your environment.

After these files have been updated, you you should delete the OCP in ventory file (`rm /opt/odie/config/inventory`) then `odie generate-config` to regenerate the OCP inventory file.  Once you have generated an inventory file, it will not be
over-written and must be manually deleted first.

#### BYO Installation

Alternatively, if you are experienced with OCP administration, you may prefer to work with the native Ansible configuration.

Simply copy your https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/configuring_inventory_file.html[advanced OCP inventory file] to `/opt/odie/src/inventory/inventory`.  The command `make -f Makefile.ocp install_openshift` (note this is the
standard installation method) will begin the installation or you can still use `odie install` if you'd like to watch the spinning.


## `odie install`

* User-friendly OCP configuration - To ease the installation burden on administrators that are unfamiliar with OCP/Ansible.  ODIE provides an opinionated step-by-step installation using a CSV host configuration and autogenerated YAML property files.  The output is a generated OCP advanced install inventory file that you can modify or just provide your own inventory file.




# KVM Configuration for ODIE Lab

ODIE has a automated deployment mechanism onto a KVM hypervisor.  The storage pool and virtual network configuration is not yet automated.  You do not need to generate a fresh ISO to use this this provisioning.  You can use `deploy.sh` to provision environments from ISOs that you obtained via another source.  You do
no
